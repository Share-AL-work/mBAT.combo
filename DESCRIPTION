Description: Gene-based association tests aggregate multiple SNP-trait associations into sets defined by gene boundaries. Since genes have a direct biological link to downstream function, gene-based test results are widely used in post-GWAS analysis. A common approach for gene-based tests is to combine SNPs associations by computing the sum of χ^2 statistics. However, this strategy ignores the directions of SNP effects, which could result in a loss of power for SNPs with masking effects (e.g., when the product of the effects of two SNPs and their linkage disequilibrium (LD) correlation is negative). Here, we introduce “mBAT-combo”, a new set-based test that is better powered than other methods to detect multi-SNP associations in the context of masking effects.
